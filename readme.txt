## Introduction

The Electric Truck Route Optimization Project is a Python-based tool designed to optimize delivery routes for electric trucks. 
It takes into account factors such as battery capacity, charging station locations, traffic conditions, and delivery schedules 
to generate optimal or near-optimal routes.



## Features

- Route optimization considering battery capacity and charging stations.
- Integration of real-time traffic data for dynamic routing.
- Management of delivery time windows to ensure on-time deliveries.
- Visualization of optimized routes on interactive maps.
- User-friendly interface for inputting delivery locations and parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (version >= 3.x) installed on your system.
- Required Python packages (install using `pip`): Folium, and any other dependencies specific to your project.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/umaraslam66/electric-truck-routing.git

Usage
Data Preparation
Modify the data.py script to include your delivery locations, charging station locations, and any additional data specific to your project. 
Ensure that you save the data in CSV format for easy import.

If you have real-time traffic data sources, set up the necessary APIs or data retrieval mechanisms to access this data.

Route Optimization
Implement the route optimization algorithm of your choice. You can choose from heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithm or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
or use your custom algorithm.

Modify the code to consider factors like battery capacity, charging station selection, and delivery time windows.

Visualization
Implement code for visualizing optimized routes using Folium or other mapping libraries. Ensure that the visualization includes delivery locations, 
charging stations, and any other relevant information.

Generate and save interactive maps in HTML format for easy viewing.
