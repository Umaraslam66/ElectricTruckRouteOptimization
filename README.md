## Introduction

The Electric Truck Route Optimization Project is a Python-based tool designed to optimize delivery routes for electric trucks. It takes into account factors such as battery capacity, charging station locations, traffic conditions, and delivery schedules to generate optimal or near-optimal routes.

## Features

- Route optimization considering battery capacity and charging stations.
- Integration of real-time traffic data for dynamic routing.
- Management of delivery time windows to ensure on-time deliveries.
- Visualization of optimized routes on interactive maps.
- User-friendly interface for inputting delivery locations and parameters.
